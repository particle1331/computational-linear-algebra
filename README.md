Notes and code experiments for linear algebra. The idea is to construct the SVD as soon as possible, then use it for everything else &mdash; from characterizing invertbility, to parametrizing the loss surface of a linear regression model. Some of the interesting stuff that is covered:
  * Proof of the real spectral theorem, and a code demo
  * Proof of the singular value decomposition (SVD)
  * An extensive discussion of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse
  * Stability of the Gram-Schmidt algorithm
  * Characterizing the loss surface of a linear regression problem
  * Characterizing quadratic forms using the principal axes theorem.
